      Represents the position of an event in an Event Hub partition, typically
      used in the creation of

      an `EventHubConsumer` to specify the position in the partition to begin
      receiving events from.

      Make use of the below static helpers to create an instance of
      `EventPosition`

      - `fromOffset()`

      - `fromSequenceNumber()`

      - `fromEnqueuedTime()`

      - `earliest()`

      which has not expired due to the retention policy.

      The offset is the relative position for an event in the context of the
      partition.

      The offset should not be considered a stable value.

      The same offset may refer to a different event as events reach the age
      limit for

      retention and are no longer visible within the partition.
